This project is about a coffee machine that have 4 resources: water, coffee, milk and money.
The customer can choose from 3 coffees: espresso, latte, cappuccino.
After the choice we need to check whether there is enough resources in the coffee machine,
and if yes we ask for money from the customer. Then we check whether the given money is enough
for the chosen coffee. If yes, only then do we give the coffee and deduct the resources
that were used for that coffee.
